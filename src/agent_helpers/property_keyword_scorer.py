      Goal
        Evaluate how well a property satisfies a set of key travel intents derived from a user prompt.

      Inputs
        - property_payload (object): may contain any mix of property descriptors such as
          title, location text, property_description, facilities lists, pricing blocks,
          area_info, or external_signals. The schema is not guaranteed - handle missing or
          additional keys gracefully.
        - key_terms (array of strings): ordered list of intents or features extracted from the user prompt.

      Preparation
        - Normalize text for matching (lowercase, trim whitespace) while preserving original casing for reasons.
        - Treat property_payload as noisy input; internally clean strings by removing control characters, stray Unicode artifacts (for example non-breaking spaces, duplicated punctuation), and collapsing repeated whitespace before matching.
        - Recognize common travel synonyms (for example spa <-> wellness, beachfront <-> oceanfront, transit <-> subway) but never invent facilities that are not present.
        - Treat booleans or numeric fields inside external_signals as supporting evidence when non-zero or true.

      Scoring Rubric (fixed 0-5 scale, 5 is best)
        5 -> Explicit, repeated evidence that directly fulfills the intent.
        4 -> Strong single mention or combination of signals that clearly satisfies the term.
        3 -> Partial or indirect support; evidence suggests the feature but lacks full confirmation.
        2 -> Weak or uncertain support (vague marketing phrasing only).
        1 -> Barely suggestive signal; confidence is very low.
        0 -> No evidence or the data is missing.

      Tasks
        1. For each key term (respect input order):
           a. Work from the cleaned payload. Search property_description, facilities, area_info, info_prices, external_signals, and any other provided fields for supporting snippets.
           b. Judge the strength of the match using the scoring rubric.
           c. Assign an integer score between 0 and 5 (inclusive).
           d. Craft a concise reason citing where the evidence came from (e.g., "Facilities list includes 'Spa and wellness centre'").
           e. When no evidence exists, score 0 and explain that the term was unsupported.
        2. Prefer factual signals (structured fields, explicit amenities) over generic promotional copy.
        3. Do not hallucinate data; every citation must trace back to the payload provided.

      Output
        Return strictly valid JSON:
          {
            "terms": [
              {
                "term": str,
                "score": int,
                "reason": str,
                "evidence": [str]
              }
            ],
            "notes": [str]
          }
        - The evidence array must contain only direct quotes or field names from the payload; omit the key when there is no supporting snippet.
        - Keep each reason under 200 characters and tie it to specific data.
        - Include notes only when data is missing or conflicting.
        - No markdown, commentary, or trailing text - return JSON only.

      Validation
        - Ensure every input key term has a corresponding entry in the terms array.
        - Scores must be integers between 0 and 5 inclusive.
        - If property_payload is empty or null, return zeros with reasons clarifying the absence of data.
